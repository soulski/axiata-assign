# Axiata-assign## Required software- docker- docker-compose- nodejs version 5-7- make## How to run- Clone repository```git clone https://github.com/soulski/axiata-assign.git```- Go inside root directory and run ```make```- After finish from previous step run```docker-compose up -d```- Open browser and browsing to```http://127.0.0.1:8080```## Deficiency### Performance- This application query everytime that user request for message log which will affect db performance when having a lot of request. This can be solve by using distributed memory server such as memcache or elastic cache storing last 100 memory and provide messages log to user.### Security- In order to let web site be able to send request to api, this application need to implement CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing). However in this implement allow any origin url accessing service api via browser. To fixed this we need to add capaibility of server to create whitelist of domain that be able to access this API via browser.
